# maze_master
My project deals with extracting a maze from an image, building a graph efficiently, and finding the solution using the A STAR algorithm.
I wrote the part of reading the image in Python, building the graph and writing the solution algorithm I wrote in C#.
For this I built two servers for communication between the two languages, Flask, and Web api.
I hope you enjoy reading and understanding the code.
